HTML Overview

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): It's the fundamental building block of the web, used to define and structure content.
Basics:

    Elements & Tags: These are the building blocks of any HTML document. An element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For instance, <h1>HTML Overview</h1>; here, <h1> is the start tag, HTML Overview is the content, and </h1> is the end tag.

    Attributes: Attributes give more information about an element. They come in name/value pairs like: name="value". For instance, in <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, href is an attribute which specifies the URL.

    Comments: Comments are not displayed on the user's browser, but they can help document your HTML source code. You can create a comment with <!-- Comment goes here -->.

    Doctype Declaration: It's an instruction to the browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. For modern HTML5 documents, you'll typically see <!DOCTYPE html> at the top.

HTML Document Structure:

    head: This part of the document includes meta-information, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other resources. It doesn't contain any content that's visible to the user.

    body: This contains everything that's visible on the web page - from headings and paragraphs to images, links, and more.

Common Elements:

    Heading Elements (h1 to h6): Used to define headings. h1 is the highest and most important level, while h6 is the lowest.

    Paragraph (p): Represents a block of text.

    Links (a): Allows you to link to other pages or resources.

    Images (img): Used to embed images.

    Lists:
        ul: Unordered list.
        ol: Ordered list.
        li: List item.

    Forms:
        form: Contains the form elements.
        input: Input fields.
        textarea: Multiline text input.
        button: Button element.

HTML5 Features:

    Semantic Elements: These are new elements in HTML5 that give a clear indication of their intent:
        article: Represents a standalone piece of content.
        aside: Content that's related but separate from the main content.
        figcaption & figure: Captioned content, like images or diagrams.
        header & footer: The top and bottom parts of a container respectively.
        nav: Navigation links.
        ... and more.

        canvas: Allows drawing graphics via scripting (like JavaScript).
        svg: For Scalable Vector Graphics.

    Media:
        audio: For embedding sound content.
        video: For embedding video content.

    Input Types: These are enhancements in form inputs, providing a variety of controls like date pickers, sliders, and more.
